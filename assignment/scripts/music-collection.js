console.log('***** Music Collection *****');

// - Create a variable `collection` that starts as an empty array.

let collection = [];

// - Add a function named `addToCollection`. This function should:
// - Take in the album's `title`, `artist`, `yearPublished` as input
//   parameters
// - Create a new object having the above properties
// - Add the new object to the end of the `collection` array
// - Return the newly created object

function addToCollection() {
  let album = {
    title: '',
    artist: '',
    yearPublished: ''
  };
  collection.push(album);
  return object;
}

// - Test the `addToCollection` function:
// - Add 6 albums to your collection.
//   Aim to have a mix of both same and different artists and
//   published years. (Feel free to share your musical interests,
//   or make stuff up. Totally fine either way.)
// - Console.log each album as added using the returned value.
// - After all are added, console.log the `collection` array.



// - Add a function named `showCollection`. This function should:
//   Take in an array parameter.
//   (This allows it to be reused to show any collection,
//   like the results from the find or search.)
// - Console.log the number of items in the array.
// - Loop over the array and console.log each album's information
//   formatted like: `TITLE by ARTIST, published in YEAR`.

function showCollection() {
  
}

// - Test the `showCollection` function.



// - Add a function named `findByArtist`. This function should:
// - Take in `artist` (a string) parameter
// - Create an array to hold any results, empty to start
// - Loop through the `collection` and add any objects with a
//   matching artist to the array.
// - Return the array with the matching results.
//   If no results are found, return an empty array.



// - Test the `findByArtist` function.
//   Make sure to test with an artist you know is in the collection,
//   as well as an artist you know is not in your collection.
//   Check that for artists with multiple matches, all are found.
